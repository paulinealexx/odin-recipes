    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar, more for topping</li>
            <li>1 vanilla bean or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy or light cream, or half-and-half</li>
            <li>5 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (or 163 degrees Celsius).</li>
            <li>Add the cream, vanilla bean, and salt into a saucepan and cook over low heat, just until hot.</li>
            <li>Let the mixture sit for a few minutes, then discard the vanilla bean (if you are using vanilla extract, you should add it at this step).</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, beat the 5 egg yolks and sugar together until light, and stir about 1/4 of the cream into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour the sugar-egg mixture into cream and stir.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into 4 six-ounce ramekins and place them in a baking dish (fill the baking dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the dish.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until centers are barely set.</li>
            <li>Cool completely, then refrigerate for several hours and up to a couple of days.</li>
            <li>When the dish is ready to serve, top each custard with about a teaspoon of sugar in a thin layer, place the ramekins in a boiler 2-3 inches from heat source and turn on the broiler. Cook until sugar melts and browns or even blackens a bit (about 5 minutes). Serve within 2 hours.</li>
        </ol>
